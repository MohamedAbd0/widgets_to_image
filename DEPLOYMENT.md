# GitHub Pages Deployment

This document explains how to deploy the Widgets to Image demo to GitHub Pages.

## Setup

The project is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Configuration Files

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

   - Automatically builds and deploys the Flutter web app

2. **Web Configuration** (`example/web/index.html`)
   - Professional loading screen with package branding
   - SEO-optimized meta tags
   - Responsive design

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment

When you push to the main branch:

1. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Setup Flutter environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Analyze code
   - Build web app with correct base href
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

```bash
cd example
flutter build web --base-href /widgets_to_image/
```

Then commit and push the changes.
